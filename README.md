# font-face snippets

Snippets for importing fonts from local storage.

* File paths assume the font files are stored in a sibling folder to your CSS.
* Font-weight naming follows [these common practices](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/font-weight#Common_weight_name_mapping), listed below with minor changes for also-known-as weights.
* In our snippets, weight 400 (normal or 'Regular') is not named; weight 700 is named 'bold'.
